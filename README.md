[中文](README_ZH.md) | English

## Overview

TLV (Type Length Value) is a data encoding format composed of the type of data (Tag), length of data (Length), and value of data (Value). This format is widely used in fields such as data communication and protocol design because it is simple, efficient, and has good scalability.

`ctlv` is a TLV structure codec written in C language, which is commonly used in serial port, Bluetooth, and even network data transmission.
